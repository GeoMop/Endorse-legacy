The repository scale model. It describes water flow and transport of a tracer along a single storage horizontal well
with random large fractures, impact of the neighboring wells is considered. Boundary conditions are given by a piezometric head field that is reault of 
a larger model.

The result ot the repository model is the maximal concentration on the boundary as a function of the time.

Further notes:

number of tractable fractures:
approx. time of the calculation:
